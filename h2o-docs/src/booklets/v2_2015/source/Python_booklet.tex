\section{Preface}
What is this book all about:
Plan for the book, small explanatory examples through out
Larger example at end of each section putting it all together, Citibike
What is H2O, install H2O for Python, load data, data preparation,
modeling data (ML), evaluating models, making predictions, moving to production.

What the book is not:
Comprehensive documentation on H2O for Python.  Enough to get started and understand
a simple but typical workflow.  More documentation available as part of H2O's
other documentation.

\input{common/what_is_h2o.tex}
Need to put into something about where H2O fits into the PyData / SciKit ecosystem.

\section{Getting setup}

\subsection{Installing H2O}
\input{common/installation.tex}

\section{Data Preparation}
H2OFrame what is it, how does it compare to PD Series and DataFrames?
H2OFrame data model

\subsection{Loading}
From disk
Also from local computer (upload), from URI, from Python local
File types supported
df (just looking at the data frame)
df data types
df column names
setting column types on load
setting column types after load

\subsection{Viewing}
head
tail
describe

\subsection{Selection}
column, by name and index, multi-column by name and indexes
row, by index, slicing
boolean indexing
setting data, adding columns, setting individual entries

\subsection{Missing data}
how does h2o denote missing data, how does it know what is missing on disk
setting missing data (can we do something like this: df[df["A"].isna(), "A"] = 5)
find all rows where A is na and set the column A for those rows to 5

\subsection{Operations}
stats
apply
histograms (and other plots)
string methods

\subsection{Merging}
row bind
column bind
merge

\subsection{Grouping}
operations on groups


\subsection{Categoricals}
what are they
how does h2o handle them
determine levels
interactions

\subsection{Saving Data}

\subsection{Gotchas}

\subsection{Use Case}
Citibike
Getting the data
Relatively small , but easily downloaded.  Everything you see here works with much larger data.
Tell about the example, what is our goal
Show data prep steps for it

\section{Machine Learning}

\subsection{Modeling}
\subsubsection{Unsupervised Learning}
\subsubsection{Supervised Learning}
\subsubsection{Imputing Missing Data}

\subsection{Model outputs}
\subsection{Model Evaluation}
regression, classification
\subsubsection{Validation}
Cover validation, n-fold cross validation, hold-out performance
\subsubsection{Grid Search}

\subsection{Making and Saving Predictions}
\subsubsection{Saving Models}
\subsubsection{Loading Models}
\subsubsection{Creating Predictions}
Differences in regression, bionomial, and multinomial predictions
\subsubsection{Saving Predictions}

\subsection{Gotchas}

\subsection{Use Case}

\section{Transitioning to Production}
POJO, Scoring, Fitting into Python pipeline using Py4J

\subsection{Use Case}

\section{H2O Python in Enterprise Environments}
Hadoop, Spark

\section{Where to go from here}
