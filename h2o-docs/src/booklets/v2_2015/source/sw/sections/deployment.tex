\section{Deployment}
Since Sparkling Water is designed as a regular Spark application, its deployment cycle is strictly driven by Spark deployment strategies (see Spark documentation\footnote{Spark deployment guide \url{http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/cluster-overview.html}}). Spark applications are deployed by the \texttt{spark-submit}~\footnote{Submitting Spark applications \url{http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html}} script which handles all deployment scenarios:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=Bash]
./bin/spark-submit \
--class <main-class>
--master <master-url> \
--conf <key>=<value> \
... # other options
<application-jar> \
[application-arguments]
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{--class} name of main class with \texttt{main} method to be executed. For example, the \texttt{water.SparklingWaterDriver} application launches H2O services.
	\item \texttt{--master} location of Spark cluster, see below
	\item \texttt{--conf} specifies any configuration property in form \texttt{key=value}
	\item \texttt{application-jar} jar with all classes and dependencies required for application execution
	\item \texttt{application-arguments} arguments passed to the main method of the class passed via \texttt{--class} option
\end{itemize}


Sparkling water supports deployments to the following Spark clusters:
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Local cluster}
	\item{Standalone cluster} 
	\item{YARN cluster}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Local cluster}
Local cluster is identified by the following master URLs - \texttt{local}, \texttt{local[K]}, \texttt{local[*]}. In this case, cluster is composed of single JVM and created during application submission.

For example, the command:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=Bash]
$SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-submit \ 
  --conf spark.executor.memory=5g \
  --conf spark.driver.memory=5g \
  --master local[*] \
  --class org.apache.spark.examples.h2o.ChicagoCrimeApp \
  sparkling-water-assembly-1.5.1-all.jar  
\end{lstlisting}
will run ChicagoCrimeApp application inside single JVM with heap size 5g.

\subsection{On Standalone Cluster}
Standalone cluster deployment\footnote{See Spark documentation~\url{http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/spark-standalone.html}} is typical for AWS deployments or local private clusters. Futhermore, Spark standalone cluster is also provided by Hadoop distributions like CDH or HDP. The cluster is identified by URL \texttt{spark://IP:PORT}.

The following command deploys ChicagoCrimeApp on standalone cluster which master node is exposed on IP mr-0xd10-precise1.0xdata.loc and port 7077:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=Bash]
$SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-submit \ 
  --conf spark.executor.memory=5g \
  --conf spark.driver.memory=5g \
  --master spark://mr-0xd10-precise1.0xdata.loc:7077 \
  --class org.apache.spark.examples.h2o.ChicagoCrimeApp \
  sparkling-water-assembly-1.5.1-all.jar  
\end{lstlisting}

In this case the standalone Spark cluster has to be configured to provide requested 5g of memory per executor node. 

\subsection{On YARN Cluster}
The most of production environments are using YARN cluster deployment since it allows for effective resource management and control.\footnote{See Spark documentation~\url{http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/running-on-yarn.html}} 
In this case the environment has to contain shell variable~\texttt{HADOOP\_CONF\_DIR} or \texttt{YARN\_CONF\_DIR}.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=Bash]
$SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-submit \ 
  --conf spark.executor.memory=5g \
  --conf spark.driver.memory=5g \
  --num-executors 5 \
  --master yarn-client \
  --class org.apache.spark.examples.h2o.ChicagoCrimeApp \
sparkling-water-assembly-1.5.1-all.jar  
\end{lstlisting}

The command creates YARN job and requests 5 nodes, each with 5G of memory. The \texttt{yarn-client} option forces driver to run in the client process.
