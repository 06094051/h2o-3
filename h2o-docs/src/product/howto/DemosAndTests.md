#Running Demos and Tests

H2O provides demos and tests in R, Python, Flow, Scala and Java for our algorithms. 

Demos contain example workflows showing how typical end users make use of H2O's capabilities.  They are specifically written to be human-readable starting points for your own exploration and use of H2O.  They cover most, but not all functionality.

Tests exercise every capability of H2O in detail using appropriate datasets and parameters, and automaticallyto verify that the expected results are produced.
