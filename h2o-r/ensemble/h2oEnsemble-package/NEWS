# News for the h2oEnsemble package. #

h2oEnsemble 0.0.5 (Pre-release)
----------------
* Fixed bug in `h2o.glm.wrapper` that, when used as a metalearer, was using the incorrect predicted values column for binomial outcomes (it was using the `predict` column of predicted labels, instead of the `p1` column.)  This was causing ensembles that used `h2o.glm.wrapper` as the metalearner to appear much worse (in terms of AUC) than they actually were.
* TO DO: Full support for `h2o.*` metalearning functions (data no longer pulled into R). 
* TO DO: Re-do the metalearing code such that the `Z` matrix of cv-pred values from the base learners to stay entirely within the H2O cluster.  Currently, we pull the `Z` matrix into R memory, which results in a memory bottleneck that caps the number of training rows at around 8-10 million (cannot allocate vector error).
* TO DO: Add support for new distribution/family arg in `h2o.gbm` and `h2o.glm`
* TO DO: Add a check that CV folds produce training sets that have both pos/neg examples instead of a constant response col (in the case of imbalanced data)


h2oEnsemble 0.0.4 (2015-06-15)
----------------
* Upgraded the `h2oEnsemble` package to be compatible with H2O 3.0.  Previous versions of this package are compatible with H2O 2.0 only.


h2oEnsemble 0.0.3 (2014-12-28)
----------------
* Fixed bug in `h2o.ensemble` that occurred when the number of observations is not divisible by the number of internal CV folds.


h2oEnsemble 0.0.2 (2014-11-17)
----------------
* Removed rounding in `h2o.ensemble.predict`.
* Updated ensemble base learner wrapper function defaults to match h2o defaults.
* Updated example in `h2o.ensemble` documentation.
* Fixed a bug in `h2o.ensemble` that occurs when the outcome variable has a generic R column name such as `V1`.
* Changed the default CV folds from V=10 to V=5.


h2oEnsemble 0.0.1 (2014-10-08)
----------------
* Initial release.
